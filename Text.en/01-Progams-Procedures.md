# Level 1: Programs and Procedures #

Welcome to the Programming Arcana! This book aims to help you learn how to **read**, **write** and **understand** code. Learning to code is a journey in which you will explore the secret and mystical world of the computer. Through this journey you will learn to take control of todays powerful and ever present computing devices. This volume is the start of that journey, and will set you up to engage with the more powerful tools presented in the next volume.

At the end of the journey you will have developed a good understanding of the fundamentals of many programming languages. Specifically, you will be able to do the following:

1. Setup a computer with the tools necessary to create your own programs.
1. Read and understand code written by others, and be able to explain how their code works and what it achieves.
1. Write code using structured programming techniques.
1. Use the command line and developer tools to compile, run, and test programs.
1. Design the structure of programs using modular and functional decomposition.

We are going to get started straight away, but if you want some more details about this book checkout the [About Appendix](#about).

## Getting Started ##

What is the first thing that any starting coding wizard needs? A working computer setup with developer tools.

Regardless of the kind of programming you are going to do, there are usually a number of tools that you need to install. We are going to start off using basic tools, which means you have to do a little more work yourself but does means that the skills you learn are likely to help you across a wide range of programming languages and tools. Keeping the tools simple also helps us focus on the really important aspects: understanding and writing code.

To get started you are going to need the following tools:
* A **Text Editor** into which you will type your program's code.
* A Command Line **Terminal** in which you will run the compiler and the programs you create.
* A **Compiler** that will convert your code into programs the computer can run.

### Text Editors and Syntax Highlighting ###

When you are coding you will spend much of your time in a *Text Editor*. The best kinds of editors for code include **syntax highlighting** where the editor uses details about the programming language to color parts of the code as you write it. This makes it much easier to find and fix small errors as you go.

There are many different syntax highlighting text editors, each will support different programming languages and operating systems. Fortunately there is now one that works well across all operating systems, covers a good range of programming languages, is extensible, easy to use, and best of all... its free! This is the **Atom** text editor. You can download Atom and install it from [Atom.io](https://atom.io).

![Visit [Atom.io](https://atom.io) and follow their instructions to download and install the Atom text editor.](./Figures/01-program-procedure/02-atom-site.png){width=500px}

<header>Download and Install Atom</header>
Before continuing, make sure that you have Atom installed. Follow the steps from the [Atom website](https://atom.io).

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to https://atom.io
3. Download and install Atom
</task>

### Command Line Terminal ###

Next, we need an environment from which we can issue commands to the computer. For this you will need to install a Command Line **Terminal**. This is a text based tool that lets you type instructions that run and interact with programs on your computer. Learning to use the command line will be an important skill as you work with more advanced tools.

The great news is that if you are using Linux or MacOS, you already have a command line that is ready to go!

* On Ubuntu Linux you can find the Terminal in the *Accessories* folder within *Applications*.
* MacOS you can find the Terminal in the *Utilities* folder within *Applications*.

Windows does have its own command line, but we are going to need a Unix command line (like with Linux and MacOS). For this you will need to either install a new terminal, or update the one built into Windows.

* **Option 1**: Install Bash for Windows 10.

    This uses an officially supported version of Bash (the Unix terminal) but still uses the standard Windows Command Line Terminal. Unfortunately this Terminal is very limited, and makes it hard to do simple things like Copy and Paste.

    For details on how to set this up have a look at [How to Install and Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) article. If you are choosing this option, follow the steps in this article to setup your machine.

* **Option 2**: Install **MSys2** for Windows.

    This is a 3rd party package which also adds a Bash command line and the related Unix tools to Windows. Its free and comes with a very usable Terminal.

    If you choose this option, follow the steps from the [MSys2 website](https://msys2.github.io).


<task>
<header>Setup and Open the Terminal</header>
If you have Linux or MacOS, locate and open your Terminal program. On Windows, either install MSys2 or setup Bash using the above options.

1. Install or locate the Terminal program
2. Run the terminal program and have it open and ready for the next step!
</task>

### Installing a Compiler ###

The next tool you need is a **compiler**. You will use the compiler to convert your program's source code into an executable file that the users can run. We are going to use a compiler called *clang*. How you install *clang* will depend on your operating system, so jump ahead to the instructions for your operating system.

**Linux**: Installing clang on Linux will depend on your distribution. Generally it should be as easy entering a few commands in the Terminal. Open the terminal and enter the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang
```

**MacOS**: Installing clang on MacOS requires you to run the following command in the Terminal:

[comment]: <> (TODO: Remove the space between -- and install)

```bash
xcode-select -- install
```

**Windows** How you install clang on Windows depends on the Terminal you are using. If you are using Bash in Windows 10, follow the instructions for installing clang on Linux. If you are using MSys2 then you can install clang using the following command:

```bash
pacman -Sy mingw-w64-x86_64-clang mingw-w64-i686-clang
```

### Installing Splashkit ###

[Splashkit](splashkit.io) is designed to help you get started with programming. It is a library of reusable code that provides tools to help you make more interesting programs. Using Splashkit you will soon be creating small games, responding to command from your own web servers, or interacting with a custom database.

To install Splashkit:

[comment]: <> (TODO: Work out how this works...)

```bash
curl http://splashkit.io/...
```

### Creating Your First Program ###

Ok, now you can create your first program! Wait... before you write your first line of code you need to know that there are gods for each programming language. These gods can be vengeful ðŸŒ©if you do not make the right offering as your first program! To please the programming gods you need to create a special program as your first code: "Hello World". ðŸ˜ƒ

More seriously, Hello World is a great program to start with for any new language or set of tools. This program just outputs the message "Hello World", and makes sure that you have everything setup correctly before you go on and write more complex programs. Watch the following video and use the steps below to create your own Hello World program and check that your setup is good to go.

</video> -->

1. Open Atom -- you will use this to enter the program's code.
2. Type in the following code. Make sure the text is the same, but do not worry if the colors are different.

    ```cpp
    #include "splashkit.h"
    #include "splashhelper.h"

    procedure main()
    {
      println("Hello World!");
    }
    ```
3. Save your program as **HelloWorld.cpp** in your Documents folder, or somewhere else on your computer.
4. Switch to the terminal.
5. Tell the terminal that you want to move into the folder where you save the code.

    Think of the terminal as currently being located within a folder on your computer. To get access to files you want to be in the folder where the files are located. So you need to **change** into that folder. To do this you use the **cd** command. This stands for **change directory** and is used to move the location of the Terminal to that folder.

    <note>*Directory* is the technical name for a folder.</note>

    For example: if I saved *HelloWorld.cpp* to a folder named *code* in my documents, I would move into that folder using the following commands. This will move into the *Users* folder, then into the *acain* in Users, then into my *Documents* folder and finally into the *code* folder.

    On Mac and Linux I would use:
    ```bash
    cd /Users/acain/Documents/code
    ```

    On Windows I would use:
    ```bash
    cd /c/Users/acain/Documents/code
    ```
5. List the files in the current directory using the **ls** command. Check that you can see the *HelloWorld.cpp* file in the listing.
5. Compile and run your program.

    To do this you need to run the *clang++* program and pass it some options so it knows you want to use Splashkit and you want to compile the HelloWorld.cpp file.

    ```bash
    clang++ `splashkit -cpp-starter` HelloWorld.cpp -o HelloWorld
    ```

    When this runs successfully it will not print anything out, but it should have created a program that you can see in the folder (and using *ls* in the Terminal).

    <note>
    Make sure you have the right quotes around the ``` `splashkit -cpp-starter` ```. These are back-ticks and are usually located above the tab key on the left of the keyboard.
    </note>
5. Run your program using:

    ```bash
    ./HelloWorld
    ```

    When this runs it should echo the text "Hello World".

## Understanding Code ##

Now that you have the tools ready to go, its time to start thinking about code. For that we need to step back and understand a little about programs and compters.

Computers are powerful, but completely unintelligent, devices. Each computer is made up of a number of components, as illustrated in [@Fig:figComputer].

![A computer is made up of a number of components controlled by a central processing unit.](./Figures/01-program-procedure/Computer.png){#fig:figComputer width=500px}

* **Processor**: Each computer has a central processing unit (CPU) that is responsible for performing actions. The CPU responds to instructions that tell it what actions to perform. Each action is very small, but the CPU can perform millions of these actions every second.
